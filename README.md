The stacki-docker pallet is a requirement 
for the stacki-kubernetes pallet.

You can use docker >= 1.10, but I haven't verified
that it works.

The full iso can be downloaded here: 

https://s3.amazonaws.com/stacki/public/pallets/3.2/open-source/stacki-docker-1.13.0-7.x.x86_64.disk1.iso

Or you can build the iso yourself following the 
instructions in the BUILD.md.
