The stacki-docker pallet is a requirement 
for the stacki-kubernetes pallet.

You can use docker >= 1.10, but I haven't verified
that it works.

The full iso can be downloaded here: 

https://s3.amazonaws.com/stacki/public/pallets/3.2/open-source/stacki-docker-1.13.0-7.x.x86_64.disk1.iso

Or you can build the iso yourself following the 
instructions in the BUILD.md.

The next version will be release in the next week. It has tls certs and automatic Docker Swarm Mode. If you're interested in that, check this space later this week.
